# Acceptance Criteria for Step 2: Repository Skeleton

## Git Repository Structure
- [ ] Git repository initialized with `main` branch
- [ ] Feature branch `feature/0001-prd-analysis` created and checked out
- [ ] `.gitignore` file includes Python, Docker, and environment-specific patterns
- [ ] Initial commit with analysis files (analysis.md, backlog.json, acceptance_step2.md)

```

## Docker Configuration
- [ ] `Dockerfile` based on Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL and Redis services
- [ ] Application container builds successfully
- [ ] All services start and connect properly

## Python Dependencies
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` with project metadata and dependencies
- [ ] `requirements.txt` with pinned versions
- [ ] Core dependencies: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL driver, Pydantic
- [ ] Development dependencies: pytest, black, flake8, mypy

## FastAPI Application
- [ ] Basic FastAPI app in `src/main.py`
- [ ] `/health` endpoint returning `{"status": "ok", "timestamp": "..."}`
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Health check returns HTTP 200

## Environment Configuration
- [ ] `.env.example` with all required variables:
  - Database connection (DATABASE_URL)
  - JWT secrets (JWT_SECRET_KEY)
  - Telegram bot token placeholder
  - Admin credentials placeholder
  - Redis connection (REDIS_URL)
- [ ] Clear documentation of each environment variable

## Database Setup
- [ ] Alembic initialized in `migrations/` directory
- [ ] Database connection configuration ready
- [ ] Migration system can create initial schema from DDL

## Documentation
- [ ] `README.md` with:
  - Project description and purpose
  - Prerequisites (Python 3.11+, Docker, PostgreSQL)
  - Setup instructions for local development
  - Docker commands for running the application
  - API endpoint documentation (at least /health)
  - Development workflow guidelines

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Code follows Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] No syntax errors or import issues
- [ ] Docker build completes successfully
- [ ] Application starts and responds to health check
- [ ] All files are properly committed to Git

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose up --build

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Run Python directly
python -m src.main

# Check code quality
black --check .
flake8 .
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All acceptance criteria items completed
- [ ] Repository is ready for Step 3 (implementation)
- [ ] Development environment can be set up by any team member
- [ ] Basic application structure supports adding new features
