# Alert Recommendations Based on 5-minute 100VU Load Test
# Test Date: 2025-09-20T17:37:26Z
# Test Results: FAIL - High error rate and latency issues

# Current vs Recommended Thresholds
current_thresholds:
  p95_latency: "500ms"
  avg_latency: "200ms" 
  error_rate: "1%"
  throughput_min: "30 req/s"

# Test Results
test_results:
  p95_latency: "3.88s"
  avg_latency: "1.3s"
  error_rate: "50.05%"
  throughput: "54.78 req/s"

# Recommended Alert Thresholds (Conservative)
recommended_thresholds:
  # Based on observed performance under load
  p95_latency_warning: "2s"      # 4x current threshold
  p95_latency_critical: "5s"     # 10x current threshold
  
  avg_latency_warning: "1s"      # 5x current threshold  
  avg_latency_critical: "2s"     # 10x current threshold
  
  error_rate_warning: "5%"       # 5x current threshold
  error_rate_critical: "10%"     # 10x current threshold
  
  throughput_min_warning: "20 req/s"  # Lower than current
  throughput_min_critical: "10 req/s" # Much lower than current

# Additional Recommended Alerts

# Implementation Notes
implementation_notes:
  - "Current system cannot handle 100 VUs - consider scaling or optimization"
  - "Webhook endpoint appears to be completely failing under load"
  - "Health endpoint also showing performance degradation"
  - "Consider implementing circuit breakers and retry logic"
  - "Database connection pool may need tuning (current: 16 connections)"
  - "Celery worker appears stable with 2 processes and 0 active tasks"

# Priority Actions
priority_actions:
  1: "Investigate webhook endpoint failure under load"
  2: "Optimize database queries and connection handling"
  3: "Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms"
  4: "Consider horizontal scaling for webhook processing"
  5: "Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting"
