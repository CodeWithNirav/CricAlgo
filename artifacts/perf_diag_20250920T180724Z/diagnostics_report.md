# Performance Diagnostics Report
**Date**: 2025-09-20T18:07:24Z  
**Test Duration**: 30 seconds @ 50 VUs  
**Environment**: Local Docker Compose  

## Executive Summary
**VERDICT: FAIL** - Critical performance issues identified

The staging environment is experiencing severe performance degradation under load, with a 50% error rate and extremely high latency. The root cause is a **user lookup failure** in the webhook processing pipeline.

## Key Metrics from 30s Load Test
- **Error Rate**: 50.00% (515/1030 requests failed)
- **P95 Latency**: 3.9s (threshold: 500ms)
- **Average Latency**: 1.01s (threshold: 200ms)
- **Throughput**: 31.36 req/s
- **Webhook Success Rate**: 0% (all webhook requests failed)
- **Health Endpoint**: 100% success rate

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: User Lookup Failure
**Root Cause**: The webhook endpoint is failing because it cannot find the test user `a59b0893-0f43-43c8-83aa-87a0dff98338` in the database.

**Evidence from logs**:
```
User a59b0893-0f43-43c8-83aa-87a0dff98338 not found for deposit webhook 0xa31f6b11cbc398
INFO: 172.18.0.1:46260 - "POST /api/v1/webhooks/bep20 HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal Server Error
```

**Impact**: Every webhook request results in a 500 Internal Server Error, causing the 50% error rate.

### Secondary Issues

1. **Database Connection Pool**: 16 active connections (no long-running queries detected)
2. **Celery Queue**: Empty (0 tasks queued) - worker appears healthy
3. **Redis**: Functioning normally
4. **Single Webhook Test**: 787ms response time with "Failed to process webhook" error

## Top 3 Suspected Bottlenecks

### 1. **Missing Test User Data** (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Test user ID hardcoded in k6 script doesn't exist in database
- **Impact**: 100% webhook failure rate
- **Evidence**: Consistent "User not found" errors in logs

### 2. **Webhook Error Handling** (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Webhook endpoint returns 500 errors instead of graceful handling
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, high error rates
- **Evidence**: All webhook requests return 500 status

### 3. **Database Query Performance** (MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: User lookup queries may not be optimized
- **Impact**: Contributes to latency when queries do succeed
- **Evidence**: Query caching visible in logs but still slow

## Immediate Mitigation Recommendations

### 1. **Fix Test Data** (IMMEDIATE - 5 minutes)
```sql
-- Create the missing test user
INSERT INTO users (id, telegram_id, username, status, created_at) 
VALUES ('a59b0893-0f43-43c8-83aa-87a0dff98338', 693173957, 'test_user', 'active', NOW());
```

### 2. **Improve Webhook Error Handling** (SHORT-TERM - 30 minutes)
- Return 400 Bad Request instead of 500 for missing users
- Add proper error logging and monitoring
- Implement graceful degradation

### 3. **Add User Validation** (SHORT-TERM - 1 hour)
- Validate user existence before processing webhook
- Add user creation for new webhook sources
- Implement proper error responses

## System Health Status
- **Database**: ✅ Healthy (16 connections, no long queries)
- **Redis**: ✅ Healthy (0 queued tasks)
- **Celery Workers**: ✅ Healthy (2 processes running)
- **Application**: ❌ Failing (webhook processing broken)
- **Health Endpoint**: ✅ Working (100% success rate)

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Create missing test user data
2. **Short-term**: Fix webhook error handling and validation
3. **Medium-term**: Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. **Long-term**: Implement proper user management and webhook validation

## Configuration Notes
- **Database Pool**: Default settings (no explicit pool size configured)
- **Uvicorn Workers**: Not explicitly configured (likely single worker)
- **Celery Workers**: 2 processes, healthy status
