   - Need to install dependencies without k6

5. FRONTEND BUILD:
   - npm not available or not responding
   - Frontend build skipped

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================

1. Install core dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements_no_k6.txt

2. Fix linting issues:
   - Remove unused imports
   - Fix trailing whitespace
   - Break long lines
   - Add proper blank lines

3. Install type stubs:
   pip install types-requests types-redis

4. Run tests after dependency installation

5. Install npm for frontend build

6. Skip k6 load testing due to network issues
