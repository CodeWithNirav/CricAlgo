# Improved Matches Functionality

## Overview

The matches functionality has been significantly improved to provide better user experience and proper match lifecycle management. The system now shows only upcoming matches and automatically manages match statuses based on time.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Smart Match Filtering**
- **Before**: Showed all matches regardless of status
- **After**: Shows only upcoming matches (not started and not finished)
- **Benefit**: Users only see relevant matches they can participate in

### 2. **Automatic Status Management**
- **Scheduled Task**: Runs every 5 minutes to update match statuses
- **Status Transitions**: 
  - `scheduled` → `open` (when ready)
  - `open` → `live` (when start time passes)
  - `live` → `finished` (when admin marks as finished)

### 3. **Admin Control**
- **New Endpoint**: `/api/admin/matches/{match_id}/finish`
- **Admin Dashboard**: Can mark matches as finished
- **Audit Logging**: All status changes are logged

## Match Status Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌───────────┐
│  scheduled  │───▶│  open   │───▶│  live   │───▶│ finished  │
│ (created)   │    │(ready)  │    │(started)│    │(admin)    │
└─────────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └───────────┘
```

### Status Descriptions

- **`scheduled`**: Match created but not yet ready for contests
- **`open`**: Match ready for contests, start time in future
- **`live`**: Match has started (start time passed)
- **`finished`**: Match completed, admin marked as finished

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions in `app/repos/match_repo.py`

```python
# Get only upcoming matches
await get_matches(session, upcoming_only=True)

# Update match status
await update_match_status(session, match_id, 'finished')

# Automatic status updates
await update_match_statuses_automatically(session)
```

### New Celery Tasks in `app/tasks/match_status.py`

```python
# Scheduled task (runs every 5 minutes)
update_match_statuses_task.delay()

# Admin action
mark_match_as_finished_task.delay(match_id, admin_id)
```

### New Admin API Endpoint

```http
POST /api/admin/matches/{match_id}/finish
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
```

## User Experience

### Before (Old Flow)
1. User clicks "🏏 Matches" → Shows ALL matches (including finished ones)
2. User sees irrelevant matches that are already over
3. No automatic status management

### After (New Flow)
1. User clicks "🏏 Matches" → Shows only UPCOMING matches
2. User sees only relevant matches they can join
3. Automatic status updates keep matches current
4. Admin can mark matches as finished when done

## Configuration

### Celery Beat Schedule
```python
# In app/tasks/scheduler.py
celery.conf.beat_schedule = {
    'update-match-statuses': {
        'task': 'app.tasks.match_status.update_match_statuses_task',
        'schedule': crontab(minute='*/5'),  # Every 5 minutes
    },
}
```

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables needed. The system uses existing database and Redis connections.

## Testing

### Test Scripts
- `scripts/test_improved_matches.py` - Test the new functionality
- `scripts/test_bot_imports.py` - Test imports work correctly

### Manual Testing
1. **Create a match** with future start time
2. **Check bot** - should show in "Matches" list
3. **Wait for start time** - status should automatically change to "live"
4. **Admin marks as finished** - match should disappear from bot

## Database Changes

### No Schema Changes Required
The existing `matches` table already has the `status` column with the correct enum values.

### New Indexes (Optional)
```sql
-- For better performance on status queries
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_status_start_time ON matches(status, start_time);
```

## Deployment

### Docker Updates
The Docker setup automatically includes all new functionality:

```bash
# Build and start with new functionality
docker-compose -f docker-compose.bot.yml up --build

# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.bot.yml logs -f bot
```

### Celery Worker
Make sure Celery worker is running for scheduled tasks:

```bash
# Start Celery worker
celery -A app.celery_app.celery worker --loglevel=info

# Start Celery Beat (for scheduled tasks)
celery -A app.celery_app.celery beat --loglevel=info
```

## Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor
- Match status updates: `Updated X match statuses`
- Admin actions: `Match {id} marked as finished by admin {username}`
- Bot responses: Match filtering in bot logs

### Metrics to Track
- Number of upcoming matches shown to users
- Match status update frequency
- Admin match completion actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Matches not updating status**
   - Check Celery worker is running
   - Check Celery Beat is running for scheduled tasks
   - Verify database connection

2. **Bot showing old matches**
   - Check if `upcoming_only=True` is being used
   - Verify match start times are in the future
   - Check match status values

3. **Admin can't mark matches as finished**
   - Check admin authentication
   - Verify match exists and is not already finished
   - Check database permissions

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test match functionality
python scripts/test_improved_matches.py

# Check Celery tasks
celery -A app.celery_app.celery inspect active

# Check scheduled tasks
celery -A app.celery_app.celery inspect scheduled
```
